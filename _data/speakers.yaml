    - "Developing Free Software is fun, but dealing with the licensing and copyright information is not. The REUSE project changes that: with three simple steps, it makes adding and reading licensing and copyright information easy for both humans and machines."
    - "If you want to grant users the freedom to use, study, share, and improve your software, you have to grant those freedoms in the license of the software. To encourage people to develop Free Software, the FSFE helps developers to understand and apply Free Software licensing. REUSE contributes to this goal. Any project following the initiative's recommendations makes copyright and licensing information readable to both: humans and machines. This way, we want to ensure that individuals, organisations and companies who are re-using code are aware of the license terms chosen by the original author."

    - "As you contemplate how to put together the system software for your next Embedded Linux project you will probably be wondering which is the best path to take? Use a Linux distro such as Debian, (or another of your choosing), or create a custom operating system using Yocto Project (or Open Embedded or Buildroot). At first sight, Debian looks easy, especially if you are using a Raspberry Pi, a BeagleBone or another board with a pre-installed Debian-derived system. So, why go to all the trouble of replacing it with Yocto?"
    - "In this talk I will show you the strengths and weaknesses of each approach, using real-world use cases as examples. Spoiler alert: my conclusion is that … it all depends what you want to do. Debian is great for fast implementation and proof-of-concept, but for long term maintainability and control of the platform, you need Yocto. Now you need to come along to see why I believe this to be so."

  abstract:
    - "The conventional approach to building container images starts by importing a base image of a Linux distribution. Then a Dockerfile is used to install the software stack. Part of it might be installed into the image through the distribution's package, while the other part might be built from source. The integration of such an image requires multiple steps. The complexity of distribution packages is not that well suited for the simplicity of container images. Maintaining software builds from source through Dockerfile is also unpractical. This complexity makes it hard to maintain a container image. Freedesktop SDK is a base runtime for Linux desktop applications using Flatpak. We have used BuildStream as an integration tool to build the image without requiring depending on a distribution. The approach used also translates easily to layered Open Container Initiative (OCI) images through a BuildStream plugin. This talk will show how (multiple) OCI images can be fully built in one pass from a BuildStream specification."

There are notorious cases that illustrate that traditional disclosure techniques lack rigorous analysis and guarantees, where re-identification attacks are possible."

However, adding noise might reduce how meaningful queries' results are in favour of privacy---e.g., in the extreme case, a completely random answer preserves privacy but is rather useless."
