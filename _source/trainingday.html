<h2 class="left">Fast track to OpenEmbedded and Yocto Project</h2>

<p class="left tight"><i>By Chris Simmonds</i></p>

<p class="left">If you are working with embedded Linux you will be aware that the Yocto Project is a key component for
generating device firmware. This intensive one day workshop will teach you how to make effective use of
OpenEmbedded and Yocto Project to create highly functional, reliable system images for your target device.
It will show you how to select packages, how to customise system behaviour, and how to create your own
meta layers. With the relevant information under your belt you will have your embedded Linux system up
and running in no time!</p>

<p class="left">The theory is backed up with hands-on labs where you will get a chance to try out all the concepts covered in
the presentations. You will build a fully-functional system using a BeagleBone Black development board.</p>

</ul>

<h3>Audience and prerequisites</h3>

<p class="left">This workshop is ideal for software engineers who
are familiar with embedded devices but need to
apply that knowledge to Linux development, and to
those who are familiar with Linux, but want to apply
that knowledge to embedded systems</p>

<p class="left">Attendees should know C/C++ pretty well, and must
be familiar with Linux command-line tools such as
'find', 'grep' and 'make'</p>

<p class="left">About half the workshop is dedicated to hands-on sessions. Consequently you will need to bring a laptop
along with you (or destop, if you can carry it :-)). Pretty much any recent laptop be fine so long as it is at
least dual core and has at least 8 GB memory. <strong>No Macintoshes</strong>, please. I will provide USB flash drives
(which are yours to keep) with a copy of Ubuntu pre-installed. You just need boot your laptop from the USB
drive. Please note that this means you must be able to access the BIOS boot menu at start up.</p>

<p class="left">If demand for this workshop is high it may be necessary for people to team up into groups of two</p>

<h3>Course materials</h3>

<p class="left tight">All attendees will receive:</p>

<ul>
<li>A printed copy of the presentations and lab notes</li>
<li>A USB flash drive containing worked solutions to the problems, plus electronic copies of the course materials</li>
<li>A free copy of the trainer's book, “Mastering Embedded Linux Programming”</li>
</ul>

<h3>Course duration and format</h3>

<p class="left">One day. The training includes lunch and a coffee break.</p>

<h2 class="left">Android Automotive Internals and Security</h2>

<p class="left tight"><i>By Ron Munitz</i></p>

<p class="left">In this comprehensive overview workshop, developed and taught by world class Security and OS Internals expert Ron Munitz, you will learn Android security at all possible levels, from the bootloader, through building Secure Applications, with focus on the Android Automotive Operating System.  We will start by understanding what the Android Operating System is, compare it to other Automotive (and non-automotive!) Operating systems, and discuss the "interim" variant of Android Auto, and explain its uses cf. Android Automotive OS.</p>

<p class="left">We will then explain hardware integration in Android, on our way to explain all the different layers of Android, concluding by comparing different Android OS products to the Android Automotive OS, laying the foundations for explaining the Android Automotive HAL's.</p>

<p class="left">Once we have done that, we will have a detailed tour of the Android Security mechanism evolution, and lay the existing security mechanisms, weaknesses in existing devices, and build the security-oriented set of mind for prospective Android Automotive designs.</p>

<p class="left tight">Upon completion of this workshop, you will be able to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Understand the state of mind of a security researcher/attacker in the world (not necessarily in Android, but also)</li>
<li>Understand how to build and work efficiently with the Android Platform</li>
<li>Understand how to find anything you want in the source code</li>
<li>Understand what security mechanisms are available at all levels, and why</li>
<li>Understand how to better attack and better defend Android related platforms</li>
<li>Get better insights on what Android Automotive is, whether you may want to implement it, and if so, how to get the right security state of mind when addressing such systems.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Audience and prerequisites</h3>

<p class="left">The training is intended for System Architects, Mobile Developers, Android Porting engineers, Integration Engineers, IT Managers, Security Personnel with Java experience, Security Researchers, Embedded (Linux, Integrity, QNX, … etc) engineers/Embedded engineers researchers tasked with Android related work in the automotive domain (but not only!)</p>

<p class="left">To take this course, you must have practical software development experience, and feel comfortable about getting into new concepts and programming languages.
It is helpful to either have prior programming experience in Java/Kotlin and preferably Android, or have prior experience with other Automotive operating systems such as QNX, Integrity, Linux and such. Strong understanding of Operating System architecture is also recommended.
However, in the one-day workshop, we will give a comprehensive architecture overview, so newcomers will learn a lot as well.</p>

<p class="left">Android development experience is recommended, but experienced Linux developers or Cybersecurity researchers new to Android would also benefit significantly from the course.</p>

<h3>Course materials</h3>

<p class="left">The course slides will be provided to the attendees in a digital form.</p>

<h2 class="left">Managing the risk and growth of using Open Source Software</h2>

<p class="left tight"><i>By Jason Hammond and Rhys Arkins</i></p>

<p class="left">Today, every company is a software company. Even companies with a core business that is not about developing software products are building software to help run their businesses. More and more, development organizations are using open source software as part of their applications in order to support their agility and efficiency goals. While the benefits of using open source software are apparent, organizations need to manage the vulnerabilities and risks associated with that use. In this session you will learn about the business impact of security vulnerabilities and license compliance issues presented to organizations that use open source software. You will also learn how Software Composition Analysis tools, such as WhiteSource Software, can help to automate and simplify the process of managing vulnerability and compliance issues throughout the Software Delivery Lifecycle (SDLC). The session will include a hands-on workshop using WhiteSource Software to scan code for open source libraries, build an inventory of these libraries, and highlight identified security vulnerabilities, the licenses associated with these libraries, and the identified risk they present.</p>

<h3>Audience and prerequisites</h3>

<p class="left">The course is targeted at Application development managers and team members, security practitioners, and compliance officers.</p>

<p class="left">Some familiarity with the use of open source software in software development projects, open source software security vulnerabilities and licenses, and software scanning tools and processes will be helpful, but is not required.
Participants should bring their personal laptops to access cloud services used in the workshop. Laptops should be running a version of Windows with Remote Desktop Connection (RDP).</p>
